- `.filter()` returns any item for which the condition is `true`.

- `.map()` modifies each item and returns a new array with the same amount of items.

- `.sort()` you get two items and you are asked to sort those two items, returning 1 if the first item should go first or -1 if the first item should go after.

- `.reduce()` returns a single value after looping over every item. Accumulating the result of the callback operation in a variable that needs to be initialized.

- You can call `.querySelectorAll()` on any DOM element, not just the `document` element.

- You can use the spread operator `...` to convert an Array-like (e.g.: DOM NodeList) into an Array.

- You can also initialize the accumulator of `.reduce()` to and empty object, perform actions on that object for every item in the array and return the object.
