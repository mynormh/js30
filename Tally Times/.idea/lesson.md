- You can just call directly a function on `.map` if you want that function to run on every item, like this: `array.map(myFunction)`

- We use `Math.floor` to know how many whole hours they tally, and then use mod `%` to know how many seconds are left after taking out the whole hours. We then do the same for minutes and what's left are only seconds. So we now have hours:minutes:seconds.
